# Members Only


This is a small-scale social media application. Users can request, accept, and reject friendships. When a user sends a friend request to another user, the user receiving the friendship request can choose to accept or reject. When a friendship is accepted, a friendship is created reciprocally. When a friendship is rejected, no friendship is created and users are notified.
